Constant version 0.04
=====================

NOTE: This module (Constant.pm) is not to be confused with the
built-in perl pragma (constant.pm), although they perform similar
functions.  Apologies if you landed here by mistake.


DESCRIPTION

Constant.pm provides a facility for creating non-modifiable scalars,
arrays, and hashes.

Perl provides a built-in mechanism (the "use constant" pragma) to
create constant scalars and lists.  This mechanism has several
limitations, however:

    It creates only scalars and lists.
    It creates "variables" that have no leading $ character.
    The variables it creates cannot be interpolated into strings.
    It works only at compile time.
    The variables it creates are global, never lexical.
    Sometimes you have to be careful with your syntax when using them.

Constant.pm, by contrast:

    Creates scalars, arrays (not lists), and hashes.
    Creates variables that look and work like native perl variables.
    Creates global or lexical variables.
    Works at runtime or compile time.

EXAMPLES OF USE

    Constant::Scalar $a => "A string value";
    Constant::Array @a  => (1, 2, 3, 4);
    Constant::Hash %a   => (key1 => 'value1', key2 => 'value2');

If the program subsequently tries to modify $a, @a, or %a, the program
will die with an error message.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, do the standard Perl module four-step:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DEVELOPMENT STATE

Officially "beta", hence the 0.x version number.  It is essentially
complete, however, and will be changed to 1.0 if no bugs are reported
for a while.


DEPENDENCIES

None.  Well, Carp.pm, but that comes with Perl.
